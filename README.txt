Doodle Draws to Canvas by continuously drawing circles as brush strokes. 
Drawing too fast creates breaks in the stoke.
Added different brush strokes and opacity options (enhancements?).
Under Edit there is a Dock/Undock option (added for enhancements).
The program saves and opens .ser (serialized files).
